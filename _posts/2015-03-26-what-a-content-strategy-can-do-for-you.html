        <p>Content connects people.</p>
        <p>A content strategy helps make that connection stronger. It brings focus to what you want to tell people. It
            helps you organize your content and your time.</p>
        <h2>Why have content?</h2>
        <p>Why have a website at all? This may seem like a stupid question. But ask yourself when you look at your
            website why any of it is there? Who is it for? What is it trying to say?</p>
        <p>There are <strong>two golden rules</strong> to good content.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>It must support a key business goal</b>. What do I want to say? For our university this might be our
                international research profile, or student recruitment.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li><b>It must meet people’s needs</b>. What are people looking for? People don’t browse for things
                randomly. Why would someone be looking at your content? What kind of task are they engaged in at the
                time?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If your content doesn’t do both of these things then you really don’t need it on your website. Just get rid
            of it.</p>
        <h2>Less content. More focus.</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Small websites are easier to manage than big ones. Since this is obvious, why don’t more sites choose to
                be smaller?</p>
            <p>David Hobbs (<a href="https://twitter.com/jdavidhobbs">@jdavidhobbs</a>)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Less content is easier for people to find and process. It allows greater&nbsp;focus for your message.</p>
        <p>Less content costs less to create and maintain.</p>
        <p>So you might be thinking this is all very well, but some websites need&nbsp;to have lots of content. But why
            have more content than you need?</p>
        <p>How much do you need? Again, what are your key business&nbsp;goals? What are people looking for?</p>
        <h2>Business objectives: putting experts in charge</h2>
        <p>Great content cannot be designed successfully by committee.</p>
        <p>A problem I’ve seen often&nbsp;around our university is that content editors are put “in charge” of a
            website. Then they are swamped with requests from lots of people for content&nbsp;that should be put on the
            website, right now.</p>
        <p>This results in a sprawling, confusing and often contradictory mess. Of course it does. But it happens all
            the time because content creation has become&nbsp;a reactive process. There is no strategy. There is no
            resource planning. There are no realistic priorities.</p>
        <p>A content strategy should help give content editors&nbsp;the freedom and confidence to create good, relevant
            content. It should allow all the stakeholders to understand clearly what the desired outcomes of the website
            are, and what priorities should follow from that.</p>
        <h2>User needs: putting people first</h2>
        <p>Think about the person looking at your content. Think about where they will be and what they are trying to
            do. What are you trying to do right now?</p>
        <p>You&nbsp;don’t really care where this post lives or how it was published. The content might be on a blog or
            it might be on Facebook or in a series of tweets? But you would&nbsp;care if you found this post about
            content strategy, and then it told you something entirely different.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know what people are looking for from your content, then ask them. There are lots of ways of
            doing this. I covered a few a while back in&nbsp;<a title="University news - who are our users?"
                href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/webdev/2014/04/02/university-news-who-are-our-users/">a post about
                personas</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/webdev/2014/02/02/user-centered-web-design/">a
                post about user-centered design.</a>&nbsp;Site analytics are well worth looking at too, but only really
            tell part of the picture.&nbsp;Taking this extra effort&nbsp;can seem like a daunting process at first, but
            it really will save time, money, and effort later.</p>
        <p>A&nbsp;content strategy can provide a framework to help you&nbsp;focus on the people using your content. Only
            then can you think about the best way of getting a clear message across to those people.</p>
        <h2>Next steps: building a&nbsp;content strategy</h2>
        <p>In my <a title="How does content strategy work?"
                href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/webdev/2015/03/26/how-does-content-strategy-work/">related post about
                content strategy</a>, I outline how content strategy works, and how you might go about building one. Or
            at least how you might start planning&nbsp;a content strategy.</p>
        <h2>Further reading</h2>
