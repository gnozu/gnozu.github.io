        <p><strong>My flat has a slightly weird mix of design styles. 19th century, 1930s, 1950s, 1970s, modern. It’s
                homely and interesting and I like it. I’m afforded the luxury of idiosyncrasy because not many people
                need to use it.</strong></p>
        <p>Unlike my flat, big websites are showcases. They provide or sell services to lots of visitors. Maybe many
            millions a year.</p>
        <p>People visiting a website tend to be&nbsp;impatient and task-driven. They might only be peripherally
            interested in what you have to say before they get bored. Quite likely you’re skimming past this paragraph
            already…</p>
        <p>Websites need to be clear, consistent and easy to use.</p>
        <h2>Consistency</h2>
        <p>Consistency is a very powerful design principle.</p>
        <p>At an emotional level consistency creates a strong sense of visual identity. At a practical level it makes
            things easier for people to use. People respond to this positively.</p>
        <p>A pattern library is a great tool to help with design consistency because it presents and defines all the
            building blocks that go to make up a website.</p>
        <p>It answers questions like: What fonts and colours are acceptable? What should lists look like? How should
            forms look? What are the buttons&nbsp;like?</p>
        <p>A&nbsp;pattern library is a guide to how an organisation’s website should realise its <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_DNA">brand DNA</a> in a consistent way.</p>
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>There will always be exceptions. We only know what an exception is once we’ve got a set of definitions of how
            things should be.</p>
        <p>A pattern library is that set of definitions, so it&nbsp;allows a website to grow and evolve consistently
            without it looking shambolic or confusing to its users.</p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Pattern libraries can also be a tool for web developers. Many libraries will include some explanatory notes
            and HTML snippet examples.</p>
        <p>A good example of this kind of library is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap’s documentation</a>.
            The developer knows exactly what things should look like, and how to use all the various building blocks.
        </p>
        <p>Other great examples of comprehensive pattern libraries are <a
                href="http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns">Mailchimp’s Pattern Library</a> and the BBC’s <a
                href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel">GEL</a>.</p>
        <h2>Atomic design</h2>
        <figure id="attachment_1763" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1763" style="width: 300px"

        </figure>
        <p>A solid way to build a pattern library is with <a
                href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design patterns</a>.</p>
        <p>The basic concept is that any good website will be made up of a few base components which can then be
            recombined and reused in clusters to form larger components. Atomic design breaks a website down into atoms,
            molecules, organisms and templates.</p>
        <p>Atoms are things like fonts, colours, buttons and links.</p>
        <p>These can combine into molecules such as a search box with a button.</p>
        <p>Molecules can combine to form an organism such as a navigation bar with a search box and some links.</p>
        <p>Finally groups of organisms combine to make a template: a blueprint for a final page layout.</p>
        <p>Brad Frost and Dave Olsen have made a <a href="http://patternlab.io">pattern lab</a> which turns the idea of
            atomic design into a practical framework.</p>
        <h2>Kent SDS Replacement Project pattern library</h2>
        <p>Work is currently under way for the <a
                href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/is/projects/sds-replacement/index.html">SDS Replacement Project</a>. To help
            make the user experience clear – and to help developers – there is now a <a
                href="http://unikent.github.io/sits-web/">pattern library</a> for the project.</p>
        <p>The pattern library uses Bootstrap as a base with Kent University styles added. It’s still very much evolving
            as the project progresses, but it already has quite a few design elements added.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Consistency</strong> is a particularly important design principle. It lends&nbsp;emotional weight,
            and makes things easier to use.</p>
        <p><strong>Pattern libraries are essential</strong> for large websites because they help make websites
            consistent&nbsp;by defining its&nbsp;building blocks.</p>
        <p><strong>Atomic design</strong> is a way of describing the building blocks and the ways they can be combined.
        </p>
        <p>Pattern libraries should also be <strong>practical guides for developers</strong>.</p>
        <p>Once we have a definition of the patterns we have a <strong>consistent way of extending</strong> them to deal
            with new requirements.</p>
