        <p class="lead">We’re planning to release a range of key web pages in the new theme by the end of February. This
            is a summary of what we’re hoping to release, and the components those pages are built up from.</p>
        <p>A couple of months ago <a
                href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/webdev/2016/10/25/a-summer-with-the-new-kent-web-theme/">I
                wrote&nbsp;about all the work we’d done on our new theme over the summer</a>. Now we’re planning to
            release a range of key web pages in the new theme by the end of February 2017. This blog post outlines where
            our designs are at barely two months before they go live. Some of our new-look pages are already available
            on our <a href="https://beta.kent.ac.uk">beta website</a>.</p>
        <h2>New content</h2>
        <p>This is the content we’re planning to release in the new theme by the end of February 2017:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>new homepage</li>
            <li>new top-level showcase pages – research, courses, engage</li>
            <li>new course detail pages</li>
            <li>new events pages</li>
            <li>new search results pages</li>
            <li>new news pages</li>
            <li>new error pages (404, 500)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Much of this has been completely rebuilt, or written from scratch following both business needs and user
            needs. The aim is to convey something of what Kent is about in a way which is engaging to a range of people
            using the website.</p>
        <p>We’ve also tried to adopt much more of a content-centered approach. What are the stories we want to tell, and
            how do we want to tell them? We’ve put a lot of time into thinking about what tone to&nbsp;adopt for certain
            pieces of content, and how each page can successfully meet overt user needs (for example my analysing our
            stats to see what people are trying to get done) while providing&nbsp;latent user needs and marketing
            expectations from the business.</p>
        <h2>Design principles</h2>
        <p>Our new theme follows <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com">atomic design principles</a>, reusing basic
            design components in a consistent way. It also aims to enhance the user experience through the use of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>space</li>
            <li>bold, high quality imagery</li>
            <li>clear typography</li>
            <li>plain English</li>
            <li>simple, content-rich layouts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The use of bold imagery has in particular been a key area&nbsp;for the redesign. It assumes a level of
            marketing sophistication not readily&nbsp;available on our old website, and web publishing has not
            previously been particularly visually focused. Shifting this focus is a challenge.</p>
        <h2>Page types</h2>
        <p>Our web pages fall into three basic types.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Feature Pages. Navigational pages, primarily visual and relatively low on text. These pages typically
                act as subsite (e.g. departmental) homepages, or key corporate pages.</li>
            <li>Content pages. Content Pages are the core content people might typically be looking for, such as finding
                out how to apply, course details, or a video of a student explaining catering facilities on campus.</li>
            <li>Navigation Pages. In between the extremes of Feature Pages and Content Pages are a range of Navigation
                Pages which mix links, images, video, and text to different levels to achieve different business and
                user needs. However their primary aim is to get people quickly and easily to the content they are
                interested in.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>High-level building blocks</h2>
        <p>All pages are made up of a relatively small number of high-level core building blocks. We’ve tried to keep
            things as simple as possible. This helps us (we’re simple folk) and it helps the user.&nbsp;Too many
            competing design elements just get in the way of the message, the content,&nbsp;and the task someone is
            trying to do.</p>
        <p>As much as possible we’ve kept asking ourselves whether a design element is really necessary. Does a feature
            have some use in highlighting something as important or useful? Or does a design feature help
            make&nbsp;things clearer for someone using the site? Quite often there are corporate or business needs to
            think about too in a design choice.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of key elements that go to make up a page. It’s not fully exhaustive, and there are
            variations of some of the elements. If you’d like to see a fuller example of our elements <a
                href="https://beta.kent.ac.uk/examples/patterns/">take a look at our pattern library</a>&nbsp;on our
            beta website.</p>
        <h3>Corporate header.</h3>
        <p>Present on every page. This consists of high-level navigation to key corporate pages, search, and key
            services for staff and students.</p>

        <h3></h3>
        <h3>Text panel.</h3>
        <p>This can be many paragraphs long (on Content Pages) or just a few lines (on a Feature Page). Text panels have
            an optional lead text section at the top of Content Pages and Navigation Pages. The lead text should not be
            used where the text panel joins two feature panels.</p>

        <h3>Feature panel.</h3>
        <p>A key element across the website, feature panels consist of a full-width image with one of three types of
            overlay: blue title block, short text, or an editorial panel with several paragraphs of text. Feature panels
            can also take the form of carousels, news/events panels, and profile panels (the latter two being a grid of
            separate elements, but presented in approximately the same dimensions as other feature panels).</p>

                    sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
        <h3>Link panel.</h3>
        <p>Links panels must always contain a link, but optionally also have a thumbnail image, and associated text.
            These panels always contain 4 cards in a row (desktop) and can consist of more than one row where needed.
        </p>

        <h3>Search results.</h3>
        <p>Results for internal Google search, course search, news or events searches. The same pattern will be extended
            to other types of search as other services come online.</p>

        <h3>Footer.</h3>
        <p>Again, a non-negotiable corporate element. It contains various subsidiary corporate links, contact details,
            and other information.</p>

        <h2>Combining the building blocks</h2>
        <p>The core building blocks can be reused on different page types according to some basic principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>corporate header, local header and footer are required&nbsp;elements.</li>
            <li>Feature Pages must always have a feature panel at the top.</li>
            <li>feature panels must be separated by either link panels or text panels.</li>
            <li>context menus always appear to the right of a text panel (desktop).</li>
            <li>Content Pages must always have a breadcrumb and page title. Navigation Pages typically do too, and this
                is one of the key ways a Navigation Page can differ from a Feature Page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Responsive high-level building blocks</h2>
        <p>For the most part, our high level building blocks translate fairly easily into responsive views, typically
            stacking elements or text over images. The key complications are in the global header navigation links,
            which reduce to a stacked set of links on mobile views.</p>
        <h2>Low-level building blocks</h2>
        <p>We also have low-level common elements. Some examples are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a gold-coloured chevron is used as an indicator of a link in all places outside body text.</li>
            <li>consistent blue/white buttons.</li>
            <li>form elements.</li>
            <li>consistent lead text font and sizing for Content and Navigation Pages.</li>
            <li>consistent use of our corporate blue and gold colours, using lighter variants for some design effects
                such as backgrounds or highlights.</li>
        </ul>
