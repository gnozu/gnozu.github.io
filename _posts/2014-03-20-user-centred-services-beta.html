        <p>User-centered services consist of a series of phases. I’ve already written about the <a
                title="User-centered services – the discovery phase"
                href="http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/webdev/2014/02/03/user-centered-services-the-discovery-phase/">discovery</a>
            and <a title="User-centered services – the alpha phase"
                href="http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/webdev/2014/03/19/user-centered-services-the-alpha-phase/">alpha</a>
            phases.</p>
        <p>The next in the series is the <strong>beta phase</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The beta phase is all about taking the ideas, experiments, and user stories from the alpha phase and building
            a <strong>real-world product</strong> which can be <strong>tested publicly</strong>.</p>
        <p>Depending on the scope of the service a beta phase may last from as few as a couple of sprints to many
            sprints. It may be possible to run a beta phase in only one phase for smaller projects, and where the
            discovery and alpha phases have been extremely well defined.</p>
        <p>Key aspects of a beta phase will be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>establish and develop technical solutions such as frameworks, hardware needs or hosting solutions.</li>
            <li>rapidly iterate over changes to the technical solution in the light of user feedback and measurements
                from KPIs.</li>
            <li>establish a go-live plan and team handovers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>User testing</h2>
        <p>Although the alpha phase collects initial user feedback, the beta phase must build on this. As the beta phase
            progresses, user feedback may become more systematised (for example moving from guerilla testing to more
            formal observation). But there must still be a regular cycle of user feedback at least once per sprint.</p>
        <h2>Outputs</h2>
        <p>The beta phase should deliver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a <strong>public working prototype</strong> of the service. In many cases this could be very close to
                the final live system. But it should be clear that it is a beta service, and may not be fully reliable.
            </li>
            <li>metrics and measurements&nbsp;to monitor your <strong>KPIs</strong> as the system goes live.</li>
        </ul>
