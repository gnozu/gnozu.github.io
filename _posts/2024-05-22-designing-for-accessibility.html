    <p>Here are a few things to consider about accessibility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>15% of the world’s population have some form of disability. This includes conditions that affect seeing,
            hearing, motor abilities and cognitive abilities.</li>
        <li>About 4% of the population have low vision, whereas 0.6% are blind.</li>
        <li>7 to 12% of men have some form of color-vision deficiency (color blindness), and less than 1% of women
            do.</li>
        <li>Low-vision conditions increase with age. Half of people over the age of 50 have some degree of
            low-vision condition.</li>
        <li>Worldwide, the fastest-growing population is 60 years of age and older.</li>
        <li>Almost everyone over 40 (yes, me included) will find they need glasses to see small objects or text.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Figures taken from <a
            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ebooks/practical-approaches-for-designing-accessible-websites/">Practical
            Approaches to Designing Accessible Websites</a>.)</p>
    <p>Think also about the times you want to watch a video but you don’t have headphones. Subtitles would be great.
        Or&nbsp;the times you wished a form on a website was less confusing to fill out? Or the times a website took
        too long to load on your phone?</p>
    <p>Are these accessibility issues, or just good design?</p>
    <p>Everyone is constrained by the world around them, and their own capabilities. Good design makes things less
        complicated and more usable for a specific audience. Accessibility is a part of that process.</p>
    <h2>Web accessibility initiative</h2>
    <p>Websites actually have a great advantage over physical things because we can shape them to the needs of
        different groups of users. We can allow everyone some kind of access to our content, even if the experience
        will be different for different users.</p>
    <p>Designing accessible websites is a complex task, because of the sheer range of needs.</p>
    <p>In 1997 the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) created the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility
            Initiative</a> (WAI). They set up a series of guidelines called the <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG) to help
        developers create accessible websites.</p>
    <p>The WCAG has <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">3 levels of conformity</a>: A, AA, or AAA.
        Most web developers will try to aim for AA compliance at best. AAA compliance is <a
            href="https://www.wuhcag.com/wcag-level-aaa/">generally nearly impossible</a> for large websites. It’s a
        common ideal to aim for, at least.</p>
    <h2>Screen reader technology</h2>
    <p>Screen readers allow people with visual impairments to use a computer, and access websites.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS">JAWS</a>, <a
            href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a> and <a
            href="https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/">Apple VoiceOver</a> are <a
            href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/#primary">the most popular screen readers</a>.
        Like conventional web browsers each interprets standards in different ways.</p>

    <p>Technology – and how people use technology – often change faster than standards, so following standards
        strictly won’t always give a great user experience. But at least a good understanding of the most popular
        screen readers helps make our websites better.</p>
    <p>A good example of standards compliance vs practical reality is the <code>longdesc</code> HTML attribute. It’s
        been around for years as a way of describing a diagram in words. This sounds like a great thing for
        accessibility.</p>
    <p>The problem is that only screen readers support it. If you use a standard browser you’re never going to see
        the description. This matters to lots of people (for example people with cognitive impairments) who use
        conventional browsers and would benefit from a clear description.</p>
    <p>So standards are just a useful tool to help us build good websites. Designers still have to put some thought
        into the design.</p>
    <h2>ARIA</h2>
    <p>A more recent development is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA</a> (<em>Web
            Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications</em>… whew…) set of standards. Let’s
        call it ARIA for short.</p>
    <p>ARIA helps developers describe what parts of a web page do, and how those parts relate to each other. It
        means users don’t have to make the sorts of visual assumptions about web pages that used to be forced on
        them (“the menu is obviously the thing running along the top of the page” or “that’s a button because it
        looks like one”, and so on).</p>
    <p>By and large screen readers are pretty good at recognising ARIA attributes in HTML. <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/index.html">You
            can find ARIA examples</a> on the w3.org website.</p>
    <h2>Colour, text and images</h2>
    <p>Colour is a fundamental building block to a designer. For readability, simplicity is best. A subtle grey on a
        white background is utterly useless for many people. Even high contrast white-on-black text can be quite
        difficult to read (I find it makes my eyes go funny after a minute or two).</p>
    <p>There are now many very good colour contrast tools to help designers. There really is no excuse for poor text
        readability.</p>
    <p>Likewise text size and line length matter. A good, readable line length is somewhere about 60–80 characters.
        Text should be large enough for the majority of people to read comfortably. There are even some fairly
        scientific ways of <a href="https://www.imarc.com/blog/best-font-size-for-any-device">calculating a good
            font size</a>. Built-in magnification tools for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android can help people who need
        further text magnification.</p>
    <p>Images are used widely on the web. The <code>alt</code> attribute is a very simple way for developers to help
        people who can’t see the image work out what it’s about, by tagging the image with a short description. <a
            href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions">Twitter now allows a similar
            thing</a>, and very much worth considering next time you tweet a picture.</p>
    <h2>Mice (and fingers)</h2>
    <p>Some people cannot use a mouse or trackpad, but can use a keyboard. Many websites are primarily aimed at
        people using mice, trackpads and fingers to navigate and click around the screen.</p>
    <p>Browsers do however allow people to use the <code>TAB</code> and arrow keys to jump from one interactive part
        of a webpage to another, and move through lists and menus. For the most part this works well, but sometimes
        developers still need to make sure they design their pages so they work well with keyboards.</p>
    <h2>Language</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is partly a technical design issue: ARIA attributes, well-structured HTML, good colour
        contrast, larger text, tabbing through content… But one of the hardest things to get right is language.</p>
    <p>Keep your language simple. It helps everyone.</p>
    <p>It isn’t patronising to use simple language. There’s a place for more complex writing, and websites selling
        things or providing services are not that place. You don’t know the context of where people are reading your
        text. They might be in a hurry, or have other more important things to do.</p>

    <p>If you take pride in making your writing over-complicated, bear in mind that people will probably assume you
        don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>We try to think about accessibility as a fundamental part of our user experience, rather than just as an
        afterthought of ticked boxes.</p>
    <p>Accessibility is hard to get right on web pages because of the many different user needs.</p>
    <p>However web designers have a set of tools and standards to help guide them. Web Content Accessibility
        Guidelines (WCAG), WAI-ARIA, Lighthouse, WAVE and Hemingway.</p>
    <p>Standards are great, but technology has a habit of moving faster than them, or not sticking to them
        particularly closely. Web designers and developers need to bear this in mind too.</p>
