        <p>A content compass is made up of a <strong>core strategy statement</strong>, and a <strong>messaging
                framework</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Core strategy statement</h2>
        <p>The core strategy statement helps us provide&nbsp;the right content to the right people at the right time,
            and for the right reasons.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Business goals</strong>. What are we trying to achieve with our content?<p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Content</strong>.&nbsp;What content do we need to provide?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Audience</strong>. Who is the&nbsp;content for?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>User needs</strong>. Why are users looking for this&nbsp;content from us?</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>An example strategy statement might be:</p>
        <p>To help us better sell our courses <strong>{business goal}</strong>, we will provide clear information about
            how we help&nbsp;people develop a career <strong>{content}</strong> to prospective undergraduate students
            <strong>{audience}</strong> so they can very quickly see how they can develop their future <strong>{user
                needs}</strong>.</p>
        <p>The strategy statement can be used to help build&nbsp;a list of content ideas. Some of these ideas may not be
            workable, but the strategy statement will at least have given the process some focus.</p>
        <p>As an example we might consider the following for our content:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Repurpose our careers section. <em>Yes</em>.</li>
            <li>Show a timeline of how we can get a student&nbsp;to a particular&nbsp;career goal. <em>Yes</em>.</li>
            <li>Provide videos of successful alumni and how they built their careers. <em>No</em>.</li>
            <li>Improve current student profiles. <em>Yes</em>.</li>
            <li>Get current students to start blogging about their studies. <em>No</em>.</li>
            <li>Provide an interactive course chooser tool. <em>No</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section10">Messaging framework</h2>
        <p>A messaging framework clarifies what you want your audience to know and believe about you, and tries to prove
            to them that this message is&nbsp;true.</p>
        <p>If a piece of content doesn’t fit in&nbsp;the framework, it doesn’t belong or needs to be revised.</p>
        <p><strong>First impression</strong><br>
            When a user first lands on the site, we want them to feel &lt;<i>xxx</i>&gt;.</p>
        <p><strong>Value statement</strong><br>
            After spending a few minutes on our site, users should feel &lt;<i>xxx</i>&gt; because they understand we
            provide &lt;<i>xxx</i>&gt;.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof</strong><br>
            Our content demonstrates that we provide just what our users need because &lt;<i>xxx</i>&gt;.</p>
