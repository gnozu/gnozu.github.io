    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Until now we’ve aimed our web redesign project squarely at externally-focused marketing content. The
            consumers tend to be prospective students, parents, or other external users looking to find out more about
            Kent.</p>
        <p>A lot of our content is directed at staff and students. Sometimes the information those people are looking
            for is also useful for people thinking about working at Kent, or prospective students. So it’s handy to have
            it on a public website. Other information is definitely for internal audiences only.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s on an intranet or public website, content always needs designing. This blog post outlines how
            we’re looking to achieve a simpler, flatter, task-based design structure for internal content.</p>
        <h2>Finding things quickly</h2>
        <p>We tend to assume people know what they’re looking for. On marketing or e-commerce sites people are often
            looking for fairly clear types of things: products, contact details, corporate ethics.</p>
        <p>Audiences such as existing students and staff usually need to find out <em>how to do</em> things, quickly and
            easily. They’re not so interested in the things themselves <em>at first</em>, because they don’t know enough
            details. Tasks not things. “How do I borrow a book?”, “How do I go about getting a parking permit?”</p>
        <h2>Task-driven v object-driven (verbs v nouns)</h2>
        <p>Task-driven content tends to be quite broad in scope, narrowing down to the things you need to find out or
            get done.</p>
        <p>The first time you apply for a parking permit you won’t have a clue what you’re looking for. Task-based. The
            second time you might remember the page or form you had to complete. It starts to become object-based.</p>
        <p>Complex tasks might involve all sorts of steps and exceptions. Making this clear is almost always a
            challenge.</p>
        <p>In our designs we looked to sites like <a href="https://gov.uk">gov.uk</a> and <a
                href="https://nhs.uk">nhs.uk</a> to see how they organise and structure their content. We concluded the
            following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Keep the user focused. Don’t show too many related links on the page. People might be looking for
                something else closely related. If they are, just put a link in the main content.</li>
            <li>Group related pages within a single topic into Guides.</li>
            <li>Keep the information structure flat. Avoid too many complex menus. Users don’t know or care about
                complex navigation and internal organisational structures. They just want to do something as quickly and
                easily as possible.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We tackled (and continue to tackle) these issues as outlined below.</p>
        <h2>Be focused: minimal navigation</h2>
        <p>We wanted to keep menus and navigation to a minimum, so the user could stay focused on the content. However
            we also wanted to ensure that each page of content sticks to a single focused theme, rather than branching
            off to lots of other pages. Some pages might therefore end up fairly long, with quite a few sub-headings.
        </p>
        <p>To help with this we’ve adopted a fairly common practice of using a ‘sticky’ menu of jump links – kind of
            like a mini table of contents. This allows a user to scroll down a page, all the while able to see a list of
            key sections on that page, and to jump to them by clicking.</p>

            <figcaption id="caption-attachment-3180" class="wp-caption-text">A right-hand menu for jump links to
                sections of content on the page.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ultimately there has to be some trade-off between number of pages and the amount of content on a single page.
            There is good evidence that people are happy to scroll through a page to read content, given a reason to
            scroll. (There are many sources, but <a
                href="http://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll">this is a good place to start</a>.)
            We’re not too sure yet what exactly our guidance will be on when to break out into a new page. This is one
            of the reasons why we’ll need to run some trials first.</p>
        <p>We’ve also tried to reduce the amount of ‘related links’ menus by encouraging publishers to put any links in
            highlighted blocks in the main content, rather than in side menus. Users are more likely to see these useful
            links that way, as they scan through the content.</p>

                important information, in the flow of content.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As part of the focus on internal audiences we plan to modify the global header and Kent Bar. Basically
            removing the global navigation menu (‘Research, Study, Discover’) from all pages with an internal focus, and
            simplifying the Kent Bar.</p>
        <figure id="attachment_3178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3178" style="width: 1024px"

            <figcaption id="caption-attachment-3178" class="wp-caption-text">The proposed new Kent Bar showing fewer
                navigation options, and a global search box.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again, this helps users to keep focused on what they need. From practical and aesthetic points of view it
            also helps free up some space for page titles and Guide headings, so the user can more easily see the key
            navigation on the page. Users may scroll, but ‘the fold’ – the part of the page users see first – is still
            important.</p>
        <h2>Guides: based around tasks</h2>
        <p>We also noticed that internal content is often broken down into groups of pages. For example pages about
            printing, copying and scanning.</p>
        <p>In the old theme these tended to be pages and folders within folders. Navigating through the pages would fall
            to yet another side menu, sometimes getting lost in the noise of side-menus. Sometimes the pages would have
            further tabs, menus and callouts within the content. It just became too complicated.</p>
        <p>So instead we’re looking at using what we call Guides. This is something used on the gov.uk site and very
            simply covers a group of pages based around a single task. An example is a <a
                href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-university-is-officially-recognised">set of gov.uk pages</a> which help
            answer the question: “Is an HE institution officially recognised?” There are various separate issues,
            categories and parts to answering this question.</p>

                    sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>
            <figcaption id="caption-attachment-3177" class="wp-caption-text">Guides have a heading section listing the
                pages in the guide. You’ll notice how the large dark blue global navigation bar (the one with the
                Research, Study, and Discover titles) isn’t there.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Guides are sometimes – but not always – sequential. They’re sometimes based around an action, and sometimes
            based around information.</p>
        <p>Guides have a clear heading section, listing all the pages in the guide.</p>
        <p>Not all our content need be part of a Guide. We’ll of course still have many stand-alone pages of content.
            But they will still follow the same principle of focus.</p>
        <h2>Flat structure: services, not organisational structure</h2>
        <p>Staff and students often want to know how to do something. They don’t – and shouldn’t – care too much about
            who provides the service. They certainly should <em>not</em> care about who published the content telling
            them what they need.</p>
        <p>Because of our organisational structure we tend to present content in different ways, depending on who’s
            responsible for the content. You could say why does that matter? It’s just presentation. But if everywhere
            on our website has different menus, different ways of navigating, as well as a different style, we’re just
            making things harder for everyone.</p>
        <p>The new designs attempt to move away from that kind of fragmentation. Content will still be under the control
            of different people around the organisation. It’s just that from the user’s point of view the content will
            appear more homogeneous.</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>We’ve recently been looking at how we can help make better-structured content which is primarily aimed at
            internal University audiences. This is work which we’re hoping to refine and experiment with on a couple of
            projects over the coming months.</p>
        <p>Our design work uses several key principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Keep the user focused. Don’t show too many related links on the page.</li>
            <li>Group related pages within a single topic into Guides.</li>
            <li>Keep the information structure flat. Avoid too many complex menus.</li>
        </ol>
