<h1>Website analysis and redesign project</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
Reduce the size and scope of the university website, which had become a massive and disjointed collection of webpages
with confused scope.

<h2>Actions</h2>
1. Carried out a series of business needs analysis, user needs analysis.
2. Scope of the university website. Data analysis looking at pageviews, user journeys.
3. Interviews with internal stakeholders: executive group, marketing, comms, academic schools, students, prospective
students.
4. Need to group student-focused content in a single hub rather than spread across many different areas of the
university website.
5. Need to reduce the size and scope of academic school websites.
6. Need to move internal student-focussed content to Moodle.
7. Need to simplify global navigation.

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
A large project with scope to radically change the universityâ€™s website. Resulted in the Guide - a hub with all help
pages in one area, rather than spread across many sites.
Data analysis pointed to how little much academic school content was viewed. Too much importance placed on
non-recruitment.
Resulted in new designs for the website, with much simpler navigation, smaller sites, more focused on marketing.
