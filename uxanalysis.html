<h1>Website analysis and redesign project</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Reduce the size and scope of the university website, which had become a massive and disjointed collection of webpages
with confused scope.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Carried out a series of business needs analysis, user needs analysis.</li>
    <li>Scope of the university website. Data analysis looking at pageviews, user journeys.</li>
    <li>Interviews with internal stakeholders: executive group, marketing, comms, academic schools, students, prospective
    students.</li>
    <li>Need to group student-focused content in a single hub rather than spread across many different areas of the
    university website.</li>
    <li>Need to reduce the size and scope of academic school websites.</li>
    <li>Need to move internal student-focussed content to Moodle.</li>
    <li>Need to simplify global navigation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>A large project with scope to radically change the universityâ€™s website. Resulted in the Guide - a hub with all help
pages in one area, rather than spread across many sites.</p>
<p>Data analysis pointed to how little much academic school content was viewed. Too much importance placed on
non-recruitment.</p>
<p>Resulted in new designs for the website, with much simpler navigation, smaller sites, more focused on marketing.</p>
