[http://gnozu.github.io/]() - this cv, and more!

[https://github.com/unikent]() - I have contributed heavily to a number of open and private github projects as `gnozu` and `mb324-unikent`. Particularly notable are [https://github.com/unikent/programmes-plant]() and [https://github.com/unikent/of-course]()

I have helped set up a user-experience vision and technical website. This included instigating a work-in-progress pattern library for a new University of Kent web theme, which can be found at [https://github.com/unikent/user-experience](). This is a private repository, so contact me if you would like to know more details.
