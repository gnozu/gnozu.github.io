# About Matthew Bull

I'm an experienced web developer, specialising in PHP, Laravel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma and UX design. I never feel the word Full Stack does anyone any justice, but I certainly have a very broad experience of the full web journey from concept to finished product.

Over the last 18 years I've built a range of large scale systems at the University of Kent, researching user and business needs, designing UI with Figma and Sketch, building in PHP, Laravel and JavaScript such as Vuejs and Alpinejs.

I often work with marketing and development teams to build great user experiences that enhance an organisation's customer relations and marketability. 

You won't find a mass of social media posts from me, as I try to steer clear of that particular minefield. I prefer to write blogs posts and focus on getting the job done. I have put some case studies on this site, of things I've worked on over the years which hopefully show the kinds of things I'm capable of.
